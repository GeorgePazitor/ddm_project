- Refactor the stopping criteria in the iterative methods to take into account the ri_next/r0_norm
testing that r0 is bigger than eps before entering the loop (so no 0 division) 

- Build the discretized trace operator

- solve zi/zi_next problem, only one is useful

Among the iterative solvers we have to verify the correctness

- dual_FETI ok, primal_CJ ok, dual_FETI_distributede ok 
    (the solvers give solutions with small differences to one another, much higher than machine precesion)

-primal_precond_CJ has to be debugged
